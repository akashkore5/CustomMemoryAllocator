# Custom Memory Allocator

This is a custom memory allocator written in C that provides functionality similar to `malloc`, `free`, and `realloc`. The allocator allows dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory blocks and provides the ability to resize allocated memory.

## Features

- Allocation of memory blocks using `customMalloc`
- Deallocation of memory blocks using `customFree`
- Resizing of memory blocks using `customRealloc`
- Memory blocks are split and merged to optimize memory utilization
- Detailed information about memory blocks and their state can be printed
